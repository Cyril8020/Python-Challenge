Python Challenge
In these files you will see two different sets of data that are being analyzed.
The first one is called PyBank and in the folder resources you are able to see the budget data for a company with two columns in this excel file, date and profit/losses.
This csv file is the data that is used in the python code file called PyBank_starter which analyzes the data and prints out a financial analysis of how many months of data there are, the total profit, the average change, and the greatest increase and decrease that happened in a month. 
This is all printed out into a text file in the folder analysis with the text file being named budget_analysis.

The second set of data is called PyPoll which is in the resources folder of PyPoll. This excel file is called election_data and in this file there are three columns, BallotID, County, and Candidate. 
This excel file is used in the python file PyPoll_starter where it is analyzed and the output will show you the total number of votes, each candidate and how many votes they received (in percentage as well), and who won the election. 
This is found in the folder analysis and is a text file called election_analysis.
